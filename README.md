# Benfords-law-with-JAVA

The purpose of this project is to verify whether a given data set follows the distribution of Benford's Law

## Background
<p align="justify">Benford's Law is an observation about the frequency distribution of the leading digits of a number from a table of physical constants or statistical data where the probability of digit `1` to occur is about 30.1% rather than 10% as one might expects if all digits were equally likely.</p>

<p align="justify">This implies that a number in a statistical data or a table of physical constants is more likely to begin with smaller digit than larger ones. </p>

## Project Structure

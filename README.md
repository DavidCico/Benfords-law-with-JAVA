# Benfords-law-with-JAVA

The purpose of this project is to verify whether a given data set follows the distribution of Benford's Law

## Background
<p align="justify">Benford's Law is an observation about the frequency distribution of the leading digits of a number from a table of physical constants or statistical data where the probability of digit `1` to occur is about 30.1% rather than 10% as one might expects if all digits were equally likely.</p>

<p align="justify">This implies that a number in a statistical data or a table of physical constants is more likely to begin with smaller digit than larger ones. </p>

## Project Structure

<ul>
  <li><div align="justify"><em>Benford.java</em> where the different methods are implemented for obtaining the data, and calculating the number of occurrence of first digits by reading a String line.</div></li>
  <li><div align="justify"><em>Driver.java</em> (main) to run the program with choice of data handling by the user and, finally will print a graph for the first digits occurrence (1 to 9), that can be compared with Benford's law.</div></li>
  <li><div align="justify"><em>AAPL.csv</em> with the daily adjusted returns of "Apple" stocks for 5 years.</div></li>
  <li><div align="justify"><em>household_power_consumption.csv</em> with individual household electric power consumption
    from UCI repository.</div></li>
</ul>
